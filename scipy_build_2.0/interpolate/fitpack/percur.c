/*  further comments: */
/*   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff */
/*   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation. */
/*   if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be */
/*   lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in */
/*   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating periodic */
/*   spline if s=0 and the weighted least-squares constant if s is very */
/*   large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result in */
/*   a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit. */
/*   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is */
/*   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits */
/*   graphically. */
/*   recommended values for s depend on the weights w(i). if these are */
/*   taken as 1/d(i) with d(i) an estimate of the standard deviation of */
/*   y(i), a good s-value should be found in the range (m-sqrt(2*m),m+ */
/*   sqrt(2*m)). if nothing is known about the statistical error in y(i) */
/*   each w(i) can be set equal to one and s determined by trial and */
/*   error, taking account of the comments above. the best is then to */
/*   start with a very large value of s ( to determine the least-squares */
/*   constant and the corresponding upper bound fp0 for s) and then to */
/*   progressively decrease the value of s ( say by a factor 10 in the */
/*   beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10, fp0/100,...and more carefully as the */
/*   approximation shows more detail) to obtain closer fits. */
/*   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with */
/*   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or */
/*   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user */
/*   must set iopt=0. */
/*   if iopt=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found at */
/*   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation */
/*   time if percur is called repeatedly for different values of s. */
/*   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will */
/*   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the */
/*   function underlying the data. but, if the computation mode iopt=1 */
/*   is used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at */
/*   previous calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number */
/*   of trials with different s-values and iopt=1, the user can finally */
/*   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call */
/*   percur once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt=0. */
/*   indeed, percur may then return an approximation of the same quality */
/*   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction */
/*   is also an important objective for the user. */
