/* further comments: */
/*   regrid does not allow individual weighting of the data-values. */
/*   so, if these were determined to widely different accuracies, then */
/*   perhaps the general data set routine surfit should rather be used */
/*   in spite of efficiency. */
/*   by means of the parameter s, the user can control the tradeoff */
/*   between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit of the approximation. */
/*   if s is too large, the spline will be too smooth and signal will be */
/*   lost ; if s is too small the spline will pick up too much noise. in */
/*   the extreme cases the program will return an interpolating spline if */
/*   s=0 and the least-squares polynomial (degrees kx,ky) if s is */
/*   very large. between these extremes, a properly chosen s will result */
/*   in a good compromise between closeness of fit and smoothness of fit. */
/*   to decide whether an approximation, corresponding to a certain s is */
/*   satisfactory the user is highly recommended to inspect the fits */
/*   graphically. */
/*   recommended values for s depend on the accuracy of the data values. */
/*   if the user has an idea of the statistical errors on the data, he */
/*   can also find a proper estimate for s. for, by assuming that, if he */
/*   specifies the right s, regrid will return a spline s(x,y) which */
/*   exactly reproduces the function underlying the data he can evaluate */
/*   the sum((z(i,j)-s(x(i),y(j)))**2) to find a good estimate for this s */
/*   for example, if he knows that the statistical errors on his z(i,j)- */
/*   values is not greater than 0.1, he may expect that a good s should */
/*   have a value not larger than mx*my*(0.1)**2. */
/*   if nothing is known about the statistical error in z(i,j), s must */
/*   be determined by trial and error, taking account of the comments */
/*   above. the best is then to start with a very large value of s (to */
/*   determine the least-squares polynomial and the corresponding upper */
/*   bound fp0 for s) and then to progressively decrease the value of s */
/*   ( say by a factor 10 in the beginning, i.e. s=fp0/10,fp0/100,... */
/*   and more carefully as the approximation shows more detail) to */
/*   obtain closer fits. */
/*   to economize the search for a good s-value the program provides with */
/*   different modes of computation. at the first call of the routine, or */
/*   whenever he wants to restart with the initial set of knots the user */
/*   must set iopt=0. */
/*   if iopt=1 the program will continue with the set of knots found at */
/*   the last call of the routine. this will save a lot of computation */
/*   time if regrid is called repeatedly for different values of s. */
/*   the number of knots of the spline returned and their location will */
/*   depend on the value of s and on the complexity of the shape of the */
/*   function underlying the data. if the computation mode iopt=1 */
/*   is used, the knots returned may also depend on the s-values at */
/*   previous calls (if these were smaller). therefore, if after a number */
/*   of trials with different s-values and iopt=1, the user can finally */
/*   accept a fit as satisfactory, it may be worthwhile for him to call */
/*   regrid once more with the selected value for s but now with iopt=0. */
/*   indeed, regrid may then return an approximation of the same quality */
/*   of fit but with fewer knots and therefore better if data reduction */
/*   is also an important objective for the user. */
/*   the number of knots may also depend on the upper bounds nxest and */
/*   nyest. indeed, if at a certain stage in regrid the number of knots */
/*   in one direction (say nx) has reached the value of its upper bound */
/*   (nxest), then from that moment on all subsequent knots are added */
/*   in the other (y) direction. this may indicate that the value of */
/*   nxest is too small. on the other hand, it gives the user the option */
/*   of limiting the number of knots the routine locates in any direction */
/*   for example, by setting nxest=2*kx+2 (the lowest allowable value for */
/*   nxest), the user can indicate that he wants an approximation which */
/*   is a simple polynomial of degree kx in the variable x. */
